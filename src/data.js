      <p className="contentText">
        British Shorthairs are relatively calm cats when they mature. They are
        easygoing in nature and talk infrequently. Very affectionate, they
        become quite attached to the people they own. British Shorthairs are
        easily trained and very adaptable. They seem to get along well with all
        human members of the household, regardless of age, but are usually not
        fond of being carried. Pets of all kinds have been kept with British
        Shorthairs, including dogs of all sizes, rabbits, and birds.

        Boasting head adornments that could have easily been fashioned by a
        legendary hat designer, along with their opulent plumed tails
        reminiscent of a luxurious ostrich-feather boa, the American Curl has
        audiences in awe worldwide. Distinguished by truly unique ears that curl
        back in a graceful arc, offering an alert, perky, happily surprised
        expression, they cause people to break out into a big smile when viewing
        their first Curl.

      <p className="contentText">
        At first glance, you may mistake a Bombay cat for a miniature panther.
        In fact, that is why the breed was created by Louisville, KY breeder
        Nikki Horner, who set her sights on producing a copper-eyed, black
        shorthaired cat with the exotic appearance of a mini or “parlor”
        panther. The black leopard of India inspired her choice of the breed’s
        name.

        Myths, legend and lore surround the Maine Coon Cat. Some are amusing,
        some are fantastic flights of fantasy and some are merely plausible.
        They certainly provide good material for conversation. Many books and
        articles dealing with these aspects of the Maine Coon Cat are available
        and have been well received as people never seem to tire of the subject
        and are always eager to learn more about this National Treasure.
